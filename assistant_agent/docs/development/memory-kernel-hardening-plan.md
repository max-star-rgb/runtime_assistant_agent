# Memory Kernel Hardening Plan

Last updated: 2026-06-30

This is the development plan for turning the current local-first memory service into an auditable, isolated, rollback-capable, token-aware, and testable Memory Kernel. Future memory engineering work should use this document as the phased execution plan, while `docs/memory-service-architecture.md` remains the current architecture and boundary source.

## Position

The current memory service is a usable local boundary, not yet a production-grade long-running memory system.

The next stage is not "smarter memory." It is memory hardening:

```text
LLM proposes.
Policy disposes.
Store persists.
Context engine selects.
Audit explains.
User can delete.
```

The main risk is not that the agent forgets. The main risk is that it writes noisy, wrong, sensitive, cross-user, long-lived, hard-to-delete, or hard-to-explain memories.

## Inputs And Prior Art

Local project inputs:

- `docs/memory-service-architecture.md`: current memory service boundary.
- `docs/CONTEXT_ENGINEERING_STATUS.md`: context pack, compaction, budget, and conversation summary boundary.
- `docs/agent-communication-routing.md`: multi-agent routing and cross-agent isolation boundary.
- `docs/phase1-7/100-memory-data-model-and-store-boundary.md`: Phase 5I memory schema/store boundary.
- `docs/phase1-7/101-memory-retrieval-ranking-context.md`: Phase 5I retrieval and context builder plan.
- `docs/phase1-7/102-memory-write-policy-and-lifecycle.md`: Phase 5I write policy and lifecycle plan.
- `docs/phase1-7/105-phase5i-memory-hardening-review-checklist.md` and `docs/phase1-7/106-phase5i-memory-hardening-review.md`: historical hardening completion and remaining limits.

External design signals, used as reference only:

- OpenClaw's context engine separates ingest, assemble, compact, and after-turn lifecycle hooks, with `assemble` responsible for returning model context within a token budget.
- OpenClaw separates memory and context: memory can persist outside the current model window, while context is the bounded material sent to a model run.
- OpenClaw compaction summarizes older conversation turns into a session transcript summary and keeps recent messages; compaction changes what the model sees next, not necessarily what is promoted to long-term memory.
- Claude Code treats persistent memory files and auto memory as context, not enforced policy; hard constraints require policy/hooks rather than trusting memory text.

These references support the local rule: learn the boundary pattern, do not copy the whole platform.

## Scope

Build a Memory Kernel:

- Durable local store with migration and transaction semantics.
- Explicit write policy and promotion decisions.
- User/project/session isolation.
- Token-aware memory context selection.
- Safe lifecycle operations: soft delete, export, retention, audit, rollback/rebuild.
- Deterministic offline tests, evals, and demos.

Do not build a Memory RAG Platform in this stage.

## Target Shape

```text
AgentGraphRuntime
  -> ContextEngine
       -> MemoryRetriever
       -> MemoryContextBuilder
       -> TokenBudgetReporter
       -> CompactionPolicy

  -> ToolExecutor
       -> memory_save / memory_retrieval tool
            -> MemoryService / MemoryManager
                 -> MemoryWritePolicy
                 -> MemoryRetrievalPolicy
                 -> MemoryStore
                 -> AuditLog
                 -> LifecycleManager
```

Boundary rules:

- `MemoryService` / `MemoryManager` decides whether memory can be written, searched, deleted, exported, audited, or repaired.
- Context engineering decides what memory is injected into this run and how much budget it can consume.
- Compaction writes session summaries, not long-term memory, unless a separate candidate passes write policy.
- LLM can propose a memory candidate. It cannot bypass policy or store governance.
- Tools adapt input/output only; memory service logic stays out of `tools/memory_tool.py`.

## Non-Goals

Current stage must not:

- Add an external memory service.
- Add Vector DB as a default dependency.
- Build a complex RAG platform.
- Let LLM output directly create durable long-term memory.
- Automatically promote compaction summaries to long-term memory.
- Save raw user text by default.
- Save raw tool results, provider raw responses, base64, inline media, secrets, API keys, or tokens.
- Trust request body `user_id` as the final identity boundary.
- Cross user/session/project scopes during retrieval or delegation.
- Let Dify, MCP, A2A, gateway, or agent delegation directly operate on memory stores.

## Core Contracts To Introduce Or Harden

### RequestIdentity

Memory APIs should eventually accept identity from authenticated/request context rather than trusting path/body fields.

```python
class RequestIdentity:
    tenant_id: str | None
    user_id: str
    project_id: str | None
    session_id: str | None
    allowed_scopes: list[str]
```

Transition rule:

- Local/mock paths may continue deriving identity from `UserRequest` during P0.
- Service APIs should be shaped so swapping to auth-bound identity later does not require rewriting stores or tools.

### MemoryWriteDecision

`MemoryWritePolicy` should become a first-class decision boundary.

```python
class MemoryWriteDecision:
    allowed: bool
    destination: Literal[
        "reject",
        "session_summary",
        "task_checkpoint",
        "project_memory",
        "user_profile",
        "video_memory",
        "product_memory",
    ]
    reason: str
    require_user_confirmation: bool
    sensitivity: Literal["low", "medium", "high", "secret"]
    ttl_days: int | None
    redacted_payload: dict
```

Default policy direction:

| content | default action | durable memory | confirmation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Explicit "remember this" | candidate/write through policy | allowed for low sensitivity | high sensitivity requires confirmation |
| Stable preference | candidate | allowed after explicit intent or repeated signal | recommended |
| Task progress | task checkpoint | TTL/session/task scoped | no |
| Session summary | session summary | no | no |
| Project architecture decision | project memory candidate | allowed | explicit confirmation preferred |
| Video/product summary | domain memory candidate | allowed by product policy | depends on sensitivity |
| Raw user text | reject | no | no |
| Provider raw response | reject | no | no |
| Base64/raw media | reject | no | no |
| API key/token/secret | reject and audit | no | no |
| Temporary debug guess | reject or session only | no | no |
| Unconfirmed inference | candidate only | no direct write | yes |

### MemoryItem Evolution

The current `MemoryItem` is sufficient for local use. Engineering hardening should evolve toward these fields without breaking current tests at once:

```python
class MemoryItem:
    memory_id: str
    tenant_id: str | None
    user_id: str
    project_id: str | None
    session_id: str | None

    scope: Literal["session", "task", "project", "user_profile", "video", "product"]
    kind: Literal[
        "fact",
        "preference",
        "decision",
        "artifact_summary",
        "task_checkpoint",
        "video_summary",
        "product_interest",
    ]

    content_summary: str
    content_hash: str
    source_type: str
    source_ref: str | None

    confidence: float
    importance: float
    sensitivity: Literal["low", "medium", "high", "secret"]
    consent: Literal["explicit", "implicit", "system", "none"]

    ttl_seconds: int | None
    expires_at: datetime | None
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
    deleted_at: datetime | None

    last_accessed_at: datetime | None
    access_count: int
    version: int
    supersedes_id: str | None
    metadata: dict
```

Migration guidance:

- Do not rename current fields prematurely.
- Add compatibility helpers and migrations before changing public API responses.
- Keep `summary` and `content` compatible until all tools, evals, API snapshots, and demos use the new shape.

### MemoryContextBuilder

Current memory context uses character bounds. The target builder should be token-aware while keeping deterministic local behavior.

```python
class MemoryContextBuilder:
    def build(
        self,
        query: MemoryQuery,
        budget_tokens: int,
        scopes: list[str],
        identity: RequestIdentity,
    ) -> MemoryContextPack:
        ...
```

Output:

```python
class MemoryContextPack:
    items: list[MemorySearchResult]
    rendered_context: str
    total_tokens: int
    omitted_count: int
    rejected_reasons: list[str]
    retrieval_version: str
```

Selection rules:

- Never inject expired, deleted, unauthorized, high-sensitive, or unconfirmed memory.
- Prefer current task relevance.
- Then explicit user preferences/profile.
- Then project decisions/rules.
- Then artifact/domain summaries.
- Include source, timestamp, confidence, and reason in debug/audit views.
- Keep raw tool result and provider payload out of prompt context.

## Storage Strategy

| backend | role | status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `InMemoryStore` | unit tests, demo, short-lived runtime | keep |
| `JsonlMemoryStore` | local/debug readable persistence | keep, do not make it production default |
| `SQLiteMemoryStore` | local engineering store with transactions, indexes, migration | P0 v1 implemented; hardening continues |
| `PostgresMemoryStore` | future multi-user managed production store | P1/P2 |
| Vector adapter | optional semantic recall | P2 only, not default |

P0 progress:

- 2026-06-29: Added `SQLiteMemoryStore` behind the existing `MemoryStore` contract, with `ProviderConfig(memory_backend="sqlite")` and factory routing. The v1 schema includes `memory_schema_version`, indexed `memory_items`, user-scoped primary key, content hash column, transactional upsert, and delete behavior that hides rows from retrieval/list/get. Store contract and runtime integration tests cover save/search/get/delete, relative paths, default sqlite path selection, and cross-runtime persistence.
- 2026-06-29: Added SQLite hardening tests for newer-schema rejection, older-schema migration hook, soft-delete hiding and restore-on-save, failed transaction rollback, concurrent store-instance writes, and stable content hash/version increments. The store enables WAL only when creating a new database to avoid repeatedly switching journal mode on every store initialization; it keeps explicit transactions, `busy_timeout`, and `synchronous=NORMAL`.
- 2026-06-29: Added `RequestIdentity` as the memory service identity boundary and threaded it through `MemoryManager`, memory tools, `MemoryAuditService`, `MemorySnapshotService`, and memory API routes. Current identity is still derived from local requests, tool context, or API path parameters; future auth-bound identity can replace that construction point without rewriting stores.
- 2026-06-29: Added optional `tenant_id`, `project_id`, and coarse `scope` fields to `MemoryItem`/`MemoryQuery`, plus service-layer filtering for retrieval, list, get, and delete. Legacy unscoped user memories remain visible for compatibility; tenant/project-scoped memories require matching identity metadata.
- 2026-06-29: Expanded `MemoryWriteDecision` into the first-class write-policy result for explicit saves and promotion candidates. The decision now carries destination, confirmation requirement, sensitivity, TTL, and redacted payload metadata. Explicit saves are evaluated through `MemoryWritePolicy.evaluate_explicit_save(...)`; raw provider payloads, base64/raw media, API keys, bearer tokens, and secret-like text are rejected before a `MemoryItem` is built. Promotion audit records now include the decision fields while still excluding candidate content. A first-pass user-facing confirmation workflow now creates redacted `MemoryPendingConfirmation` records for sensitive-but-confirmable explicit saves, and only persists memory after explicit confirm.
- 2026-06-29: Added `MemoryContextBuilder` as a memory-local token-aware injection boundary. It renders the existing memory layers, estimates tokens deterministically, honors optional memory token budgets, rejects sensitive/expired items from injection, and reports injected IDs, token count, budget, omitted count, rejection reasons, and retrieval version through `memory_context_*` metadata. Global assistant context compaction still uses the existing context-engine character budget unless separately changed.
- 2026-06-29: Added an offline memory retrieval eval baseline through `assistant_agent.memory.retrieval_eval` and `scripts/run_evals.py --suite memory`. The initial suite covers relevant retrieval, correct empty recall, cross-user isolation, expired exclusion, sensitive memory non-injection, and memory token budget compliance. Summary metrics include Recall@k, MRR, false-positive rate, correct-empty rate, cross-user leakage rate, sensitive/expired injection rate, and token budget compliance.
- 2026-06-29: Added first-pass user-scoped memory export and expired-memory retention sweep through `MemoryAuditService` and API routes. The sweep supports dry-run, soft-delete, and explicit hard-delete modes while preserving identity scoping. `InMemoryStore`, `JsonlMemoryStore`, and `SQLiteMemoryStore` expose a `hard_delete(...)` hook; production-grade audit log storage and rollback/rebuild remain future work.
- 2026-06-29: Added bounded in-process `MemoryAuditEvent` and `MemoryMetricsReport` foundation. `MemoryManager` records context load, explicit save/reject, promotion decision, soft delete, hard delete, session delete, and user-clear events; `MemoryAuditService` records export and retention-sweep events and exposes `/events` and `/metrics` API views. This established the local/API event shape before the SQLite durable storage work below.
- 2026-06-29: Added SQLite schema v2 durable audit-event storage. `SQLiteMemoryStore` now persists `MemoryAuditEvent` rows in `memory_audit_events`, migrates v0/v1 databases to v2, rejects newer schemas before mutating them, and supports user/type scoped event reads across runtime restarts. Tests cover v1 audit migration, corrupt database rejection, audit-event transaction rollback, persisted event identity filtering, and cross-instance event reads. External metrics export remains future work.
- 2026-06-29: Added SQLite schema v3 durable memory-confirmation storage. `SQLiteMemoryStore` now persists `MemoryPendingConfirmation` rows in `memory_confirmations`, migrates v2 databases to v3, supports cross-runtime confirmation list/confirm/reject, and includes confirmations in backup/restore/index rebuild. Tests cover v2 migration, confirmation transaction rollback, cross-instance confirmation, and backup/restore coverage.
- 2026-06-29: Added local SQLite operator helpers and runbook. `SQLiteMemoryStore.backup_to(...)`, `restore_backup(...)`, `integrity_check()`, and `rebuild_indexes()` cover memory rows, audit events, and confirmations. Tests cover backup/restore contents, explicit overwrite behavior, failed restore preserving the current target, and index rebuild. `docs/development/memory-sqlite-operator-runbook.md` now documents backup, restore, corruption response, migration rollback, and validation steps. Remote backup policy and production retention remain future work.
- 2026-06-29: Added first-pass `user_profile` rebuild/repair. `MemoryManager.rebuild_user_profile_for_identity(...)` derives the compact profile from current unexpired, unscoped preference/product/task memories, reports missing/stale/orphaned/out-of-sync state, and can create, update, or delete the `user_profile` item. `MemoryAuditService` and API routes expose status and rebuild operations, with `memory_profile_repaired` audit events and profile metrics. Scoped tenant/project profiles and richer conflict resolution remain future work.
- 2026-06-29: Added first-pass consent policy and sensitive explicit-memory confirmation flow. `MemoryManager.save_explicit(...)` now creates `MemoryPendingConfirmation` state for `require_user_confirmation=True`, `memory_save` returns a recoverable partial result with `confirmation_id`, and `MemoryAuditService` plus API routes expose list/confirm/reject operations. Confirming a pending item re-runs the normal explicit-memory builder on the redacted payload before storage; rejecting leaves no durable memory item. SQLite persists pending/resolved confirmations; non-SQLite stores without confirmation methods still use the process-local fallback.
- 2026-06-30: Added SQLite test/performance governance. `SQLiteMemoryStore` keeps production defaults but accepts validated constructor pragmas for focused tests; store-boundary tests use `synchronous="OFF"` locally, while manual test setup connections use fast pragmas, to avoid slow fsync-heavy temp filesystem behavior. The focused SQLite boundary duration dropped from roughly 100 seconds to roughly 12 seconds while preserving migration, rollback, backup/restore, confirmation, and concurrency coverage.
- 2026-06-30: Formalized the cross-backend memory-confirmation store contract. `MemoryStore` now includes confirmation save/get/list/delete methods, and `JsonlMemoryStore` persists redacted pending/resolved confirmations in a sidecar file such as `long_term_memories.confirmations.jsonl`. Store-boundary tests now cover confirmation CRUD across InMemory, JSONL, and SQLite, plus JSONL cross-instance confirm-and-save behavior. The manager fallback remains only for legacy/non-conforming custom stores.
- 2026-06-30: Added first-pass deterministic profile conflict/supersedes handling. Explicit preference memories can carry a safe `preference_key`; new active preferences with the same key and governance scope supersede older conflicting preferences through `content["superseded_by_memory_id"]` / `content["supersedes_memory_ids"]`. User-profile rebuild now excludes superseded sources and reports `superseded_source_memory_ids` plus `profile_conflicts`; only multiple active conflicting memories are treated as unresolved conflicts. This is key-based governance, not semantic/LLM conflict inference.
- 2026-06-30: Extended memory retrieval evals to cover superseded preference behavior. `MemoryRetrievalStrategy` excludes superseded items from active retrieval/context by default while leaving them available to audit/list/export paths. Retrieval eval setup can now create realistic state through explicit saves, and the memory eval suite asserts that old superseded preferences do not enter retrieval, injection, or active profile sources while the new preference remains recallable.
- 2026-06-30: Added an explicit debug boundary for superseded retrieval. `MemoryQuery.include_superseded` defaults to false, so ordinary retrieval and agent context still exclude old superseded memories. `MemorySnapshotService` and `GET /memory/users/{user_id}/snapshot?include_superseded=true` can inspect the full chain for debugging, while agent-callable memory tools do not expose the flag through tool input.
- 2026-06-30: Formalized LLM-first memory tool selection. In assistant-loop non-mock runs, the LLM remains the selector for `memory_save` and `memory_retrieval`; `memory_save` must declare `source_intent`, `source_reason`, `future_use`, and `evidence`. Keyword and vector signals do not participate in current source-intent decisions.

SQLite P0 requirements:

- `schema_version` table. SQLite schema v3 exists; v1 was memory-item only, v2 adds durable audit events, and v3 adds durable confirmations.
- Forward migrations and rollback notes. Migration hook, newer-schema rejection, audit-event migration, corrupt database rejection, and audit rollback tests exist; operator rollback/runbook notes still needed.
- Transaction wrapper for save/update/delete/profile upsert. Store-level save/delete rollback tests exist; profile rebuild/repair is covered at service/store-boundary level, while profile-specific transaction rollback tests still need broader coverage.
- Unique user-scoped content hash or dedupe key. Current primary key is `(user_id, memory_id)` with `content_hash`; dedupe-key policy remains future work.
- Indexes for `user_id`, `project_id`, `session_id`, `scope`, `kind`, `expires_at`, `deleted_at`, `content_hash`. Current schema indexes `user_id`, `session_id`, `memory_type`, `expires_at`, `deleted_at`, and `content_hash`; project/scope/kind fields wait for schema evolution.
- Soft delete support. Delete hides SQLite rows via `deleted_at`, restore-on-save is tested, and a user-scoped retention sweeper can soft-delete or explicitly hard-delete expired items.
- Backup/export path. First-pass user export API and local SQLite backup/restore/runbook are implemented; remote backup packaging and deployment retention policy remain future work.
- Corruption/migration failure tests. Newer-schema rejection, corrupt database rejection, and audit-event rollback are covered; broader migration rollback tests and restore drills remain future work.

## Lifecycle And Privacy

Memory lifecycle must support:

- Soft delete.
- Hard delete or retention sweeper.
- User export.
- Session delete.
- TTL expiry.
- Profile rebuild/repair.
- Audit log for writes, rejections, deletes, migrations, and policy decisions.

Privacy rules:

- Raw provider responses and raw tool outputs stay out of memory.
- Artifact/media bodies stay behind refs.
- Secret-like content is rejected, not merely hidden.
- Memory is context, not enforcement. Enforcement belongs to validator, policy, auth, sandbox, and runtime profiles.

## Observability

Add memory metrics and trace fields before adding more intelligence.

Counters/histograms:

```text
memory.write.allowed.count
memory.write.rejected.count
memory.write.needs_confirmation.count
memory.search.count
memory.search.empty.count
memory.search.hit.count
memory.search.latency_ms
memory.context.injected_tokens
memory.context.omitted_items
memory.context.rejected_sensitive_items
memory.delete.soft.count
memory.delete.hard.count
memory.export.count
memory.ttl.expired.count
memory.ttl.swept.count
memory.profile.update.count
memory.profile.conflict.count
memory.store.error.count
memory.store.transaction.rollback.count
```

Per run trace/debug summary:

```text
memory_query
retrieved_memory_ids
injected_memory_ids
memory_tokens
rejected_memory_reasons
write_candidates
write_decisions
memory_tool_selection
```

Trace output must stay redacted.

## Eval Before Embeddings

Do not add embeddings before a deterministic retrieval eval exists.

Minimum eval cases:

| query | expected behavior |
| --- | --- |
| "上次那个黑色包是什么风格？" | retrieve the relevant product/task memory |
| "我之前喜欢什么配色？" | retrieve user preference/profile memory |
| "刚才让我放到客厅的是哪个商品？" | retrieve task checkpoint or product memory |
| "我预算是多少？" | retrieve budget preference or correctly return none |
| unrelated concrete entity | return empty, not recent unrelated memory |
| expired item query | exclude expired item by default |
| cross-user query | no leakage |
| high-sensitive memory | not injected |
| tiny budget | respect memory token budget |
| superseded preference | exclude old preference from active retrieval/context/profile and retrieve the new preference |

Metrics:

- Recall@k.
- MRR.
- False positive rate.
- Correct empty recall rate.
- Expired exclusion rate.
- Cross-user leakage rate.
- Sensitive injection rate.
- Token budget compliance.

## Phased Plan

### P0: Memory Kernel Foundation

Goal: local engineering-grade memory, still offline and deterministic.

Work:

1. Add `SQLiteMemoryStore`. Initial implementation done on 2026-06-29.
2. Add schema version and migration runner. Initial v1 schema, v2 audit-event migration, v3 confirmation migration, migration hook, newer-schema rejection, corrupt database rejection, audit/confirmation rollback tests, and local operator rollback runbook done on 2026-06-29; deployment-specific restore drills remain future work.
3. Add transaction/lock behavior and user-scoped unique dedupe key.
4. Shape `RequestIdentity` and thread it through service APIs where practical. Initial request-derived identity boundary is implemented on 2026-06-29; service-layer project/tenant/scope filtering is in place for scoped memories. Auth-bound principal integration and database-level tenant/project indexes remain future work.
5. Promote `MemoryWritePolicy` into a decision object with allow/reject/confirmation reasons. Initial `MemoryWriteDecision` fields, explicit-save/promotion-candidate evaluation, first-pass user-facing confirmation workflow, SQLite durable confirmation queue storage, and JSONL confirmation sidecar persistence are implemented.
6. Add token-aware `MemoryContextBuilder` behind existing context metadata. Initial memory-local builder and metadata reporting are implemented on 2026-06-29; broader memory evals and trace metrics remain future work.
7. Add soft delete, export, and audit log foundation. Soft-delete behavior, user export, retention sweep, in-process audit events, SQLite durable audit-event/confirmation storage, local backup/restore helpers, and derived local metrics are implemented; external metrics export and production backup policy remain future work.
8. Keep `InMemoryStore` and `JsonlMemoryStore` as local/offline paths.
9. Add retrieval eval suite before vector work. Initial offline retrieval eval suite and summary metrics are implemented on 2026-06-29; broader corpus coverage and regression thresholds remain future work.
10. Record LLM-first hybrid memory tool selection signals before enabling rule/vector-triggered candidates. Initial metadata and trace summary are implemented on 2026-06-30; candidate escalation remains future work.
11. Add store corruption, migration, and concurrency tests.

Acceptance:

- Default mock/local/offline path unchanged.
- Existing pytest/eval/demo flows remain offline.
- No raw provider response, base64, raw media, API key, or secret can be saved.
- Search/delete/export remain user-scoped.
- Deleted memory is not retrieved or injected.
- Expired memory is not injected by default.
- Superseded memory is not retrieved or injected by default, but can be inspected through explicit debug/audit paths.
- Memory context respects configured token budget.
- SQLite path passes store contract tests.
- JSONL remains supported for debug/local compatibility.

### P1: Governance And Lifecycle

Goal: user-visible control and operator-safe lifecycle.

Work:

1. Retention sweeper.
2. Soft delete to hard delete flow.
3. User export API/CLI.
4. Profile rebuild/repair. First-pass global user-profile check and repair is implemented; scoped profiles and richer conflict resolution remain future work.
5. Conflict detection and supersedes chain. First-pass deterministic `preference_key` conflict handling and profile reporting is implemented; semantic conflict inference, scoped profiles, and cross-backend schema indexes remain future work.
6. Memory metrics.
7. Migration rollback/index rebuild/backup restore runbook. Local SQLite runbook is implemented; production restore drills and deployment policy remain future work.
8. Consent policy.
9. Sensitive memory confirmation flow. First-pass confirmation state, SQLite durable confirmation persistence, JSONL confirmation sidecar persistence, tool partial result, service/API list/confirm/reject, audit events, and metrics are implemented; production auth-bound confirmation UX remains future work.

Acceptance:

- User can list, inspect, export, and delete long-term memory.
- System can explain why a memory was written, rejected, injected, omitted, or deleted.
- Sweeper does not break audit.
- Profile can be rebuilt from source memory items. First-pass global rebuild/repair is implemented.
- Superseded profile sources are excluded from the active profile and remain explainable through profile status.
- Sensitive memory cannot become durable without the configured confirmation path.
- Pending confirmations can be listed, confirmed, rejected, audited, and persisted across SQLite and JSONL runtime restarts.

### P2: Intelligence After Baselines

Goal: improve recall only after deterministic baselines exist.

Work:

1. Optional embedding adapter.
2. Optional vector store adapter.
3. Hybrid retrieval.
4. Reranking behind a deterministic/mocked interface.
5. LLM-generated memory candidates.
6. Dreaming-like promotion job with thresholds and review.
7. Preference aging/decay.
8. Stale memory conflict resolution.

Acceptance:

- All intelligent features are opt-in.
- Local tests do not require network providers.
- Embedding/vector failure does not silently become mock success.
- Retrieval eval improves without raising false positives or leakage.
- Promotion decisions are auditable and reversible.

### P3: Multi-Agent Integration

Goal: memory remains isolated under explicit local/remote agent routing.

Work:

1. Ensure delegated tasks carry parent run, correlation, user, session, project, and budget metadata.
2. Prevent Agent A from directly reading Agent B's memory store.
3. Add memory budget accounting for delegated work.
4. Add gateway/A2A memory isolation tests.
5. Only then consider shared project memory with explicit scope and allowlist.

Acceptance:

- Default `/agent/run`, CLI, eval, and Web demo remain single-agent.
- Multi-agent memory access is scoped and auditable.
- A2A/remote agent adapters never operate stores directly.

## Implementation Rules

- Start each implementation task from this plan and `docs/memory-service-architecture.md`.
- Keep every step mock/local/offline by default.
- Add tests before replacing JSONL behavior.
- Prefer small migrations over large schema rewrites.
- Keep public API compatibility unless a migration task explicitly changes it.
- Document every new durable field, lifecycle transition, and audit event.

## Suggested Task Order

1. `SQLiteMemoryStore` contract tests.
2. SQLite schema/migration skeleton.
3. Transactional save/delete/profile upsert.
4. Soft delete and export.
5. `RequestIdentity` service API shape.
6. `MemoryWriteDecision` and candidate evaluation.
7. Token-aware `MemoryContextBuilder`.
8. Retrieval eval suite.
9. Metrics/trace summaries.
10. Retention sweeper and repair tools.
